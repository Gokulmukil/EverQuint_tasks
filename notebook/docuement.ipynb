As atoms are too small \\nwith diameter of 10 –10 m and weigh \\napproximately 10 –27 kg, it is not possible \\nto measure their mass directly. Hence it is \\nproposed to have relative scale based on a \\nstandard atom.\\n The C-12 atom is considered as \\nstandard by the IUPAC (International \\nUnion of Pure and Applied Chemistry), \\nand its mass is fixed as 12 amu (or) u. \\nThe amu (or) unified atomic mass unit \\nis defined as one twelfth of the mass of a \\nCarbon-12 atom in its ground state.\\ni.e. 1 amu (or) 1u ≈ 1.6605 × 10 –27 kg.\\n  In this scale, the relative atomic \\nmass is defined as the ratio of the average \\natomic mass to the unified atomic  \\nmass unit.\\nRelative atomic mass (A r)\\n  = \\nAverage mass of the atom\\nUnified atomic mass\\nFor example,\\nRelative atomic mass of hydrogen (A r)H \\n=   \\nAverage mass of H-atom (in kg)\\n1.6605 × 10–27 kg\\n= \\n1.6736 × 10–27 kg\\n1.6605 × 10–27 kg\\n=   1.0078 ≈ 1.008 u.\\n Since most of the elements consist \\nof isotopes that differ in mass, we use \\naverage atomic mass. Average atomic mass \\nis defined as the average of the atomic \\nmasses of all atoms in their naturally \\noccurring isotopes. For example, chlorine \\nconsists of two naturally occurring \\nisotopes 17Cl35 and 17Cl37 in the ratio 77 \\n: 23, the average relative atomic mass of \\nchlorine is \\n=      (35 × 77) + (37 × 23)\\n100    \\n= 35.46 u\\n1.3.2 Molecular Mass \\n S imilar to relative atomic mass, \\nrelative molecular mass is defined as the  \\nratio of the mass of a molecule to the \\nunified atomic mass unit.

If the \\nreaction is carried out with stoichiometric \\nquantities of reactants, then all the \\nreactants will be converted into products. \\nOn the other hand, when a reaction is \\ncarried out using non-stoichiometric \\nquantities of the reactants, the product \\nyield will be determined by the reactant \\nthat is completely consumed. It limits the \\nfurther reaction from taking place and is \\ncalled as the limiting reagent. The other \\nreagents which are in excess are called the \\nexcess reagents.\\n Recall the analogy that we used \\nin stoichiometry concept i.e. kesari \\npreparation,\\n As per the recipe requirement, 2 \\ncups of sugar are needed for every cup of \\nrava. Consider a situation where 8 cups \\nof sugar and 3 cups of rava are available \\n(all other ingredients are in excess), as \\nper the cooking recipe,  we require 3 cups \\nof rava and 6 cups of sugar to prepare 18 \\ncups of kesari. Even though we have 2 \\nmore cups of sugar left, we cannot make \\nany more quantity of Kesari as there is no \\nrava available and hence rava limits the \\nquantity of Kesari in this case.

Do you know the reason \\nbehind this colour change? It is because of \\na chemical reaction called oxidation. We \\ncome across oxidation reactions in our \\ndaily life. For example 1) burning of LPG \\ngas   2) rusting of iron\\nFig. 1.4 Oxidation reactions in daily life\\n3) Oxidation of carbohydrates, lipids, etc. \\ninto CO 2 and H 2O to produce energy  \\nin the living organisms.\\n All oxidation reactions are \\naccompanied by reduction reactions \\nand vice versa. Such reactions are called \\nredox reactions. As per the classical \\nconcept, addition of oxygen (or) removal \\nof hydrogen is called oxidation and the \\nreverse is called reduction.\\n Even a small amount of oxygen \\npresent in air leads to the rusting \\nof iron, i.e. iron is oxidised to Fe 3+. \\nBut the Fe 2+ present in haemoglobin which binds \\noxygen during transport of oxygen from lungs to \\ntissues never gets oxidised. Do you know why? \\n The answer lies in the structural features \\nof haemoglobin. Haemoglobin contains four sub \\nunits each with a porphyrin ring (heme) attached \\nto the protein (globin) molecule. In this structure, \\nthe iron (Fe 2+) forms a co-ordination complex \\nwith an octahedral geometry. The four positions \\nof the octahedron are occupied by porphyrin \\nrings, fifth position is filled by imidazole ring of a \\nhistidine residue and the sixth position is utilized \\nfor binding the oxygen molecule. Generally the \\nFe2+ in heme is susceptible to oxidation. Since \\nthe Fe2+ ion in haemoglobin is surrounded by the \\nglobin protein chain that provides a hydrophobic \\nenvironment, the oxidation  of Fe 2+ becomes \\ndifficult.  However, 3% of haemoglobin is oxidised \\nto methemoglobin (haemoglobin where the iron is \\npresent in Fe 3+ state and oxygen does not bind to \\nthis) daily. The enzyme methemoglobin reductase \\nreduces it back to haemoglobin.\\nCyanide poisoning : While oxygen binds \\nreversibly to haemoglobin, cyanide binds \\nirreversibly to haemoglobin and blocks oxygen \\nbinding. As a result the transport of oxygen \\nfrom the lungs to tissues is stopped. It leads to \\nthe quick  death of the person.  \\nHaemoglobin and oxygen transport\\n11th Std Chemistry 001-037.indd   1911th Std Chemistry 001-037.indd   19 23-12-2021   15:03:2823-12-2021   15:03:28'),\n",

All things that we come across \\nin life are made of matter. Anything that has \\nmass and occupies space is called matter. \\nMatter is classified based on the physical \\nstate and by chemical composition. An \\nelement consists of only one type of atom. \\nCompounds contain two or more atoms \\nof same or different elements and their \\nproperties are different from those of its \\nconstituent elements. \\n Atoms are too small to measure their \\nmasses directly. The IUPAC introduced \\nrelative scale of mass based on a standard \\natom C-12. One twelfth of the mass of a \\nCarbon-12 atom in its ground state is \\ncalled as Unified atomic mass. 1 amu (or) \\n1u ≈ 1.6605 × 10 –27 kg. Relative atomic \\nmass is defined as the ratio of the average \\natomic mass to the unified atomic mass \\nunit. Average atomic mass of an element is \\nthe average of the atomic masses of all its \\nnaturally occurring isotopes. Molecular \\nmass is the ratio of the mass of a molecule \\nto the unified atomic mass unit. Relative \\nmolecular mass is obtained by adding the \\nrelative atomic masses of its constituent \\natoms.\\n Amounts of substances are usually  \\nexpressed in moles. A mole is the amount \\nof substance which contains as many \\nelementary entities as there are in 12 gram \\nof Carbon- 12 isotope. Avogadro number \\nis the total number of entities present in \\none mole of any substance and is equal \\nto 6.022 x 10 23. Molar mass is the mass of \\none mole of that substance expressed in  \\ng mol-1.  One mole of an ideal gas occupies \\na volume of 22.4 litre at 273 K and 1 atm \\npressure. Similar to the mole concept, the \\nconcept of equivalent mass is also used \\nin analytical chemistry. Gram equivalent \\nmass is the mass of an element (compound/\\nion) that combines or displaces 1.008 g \\nhydrogen, 8 g oxygen or 35.5 g chlorine. \\nElemental analysis of a compound gives \\nthe mass percentage of atoms from \\nwhich empirical and molecular formula \\nare calculated. Empirical formula is the \\nsimplest ratio of the number of different \\natoms present in one molecule of the \\ncompound. Molecular formula is the \\nformula written with the actual number of \\ndifferent atoms present in one molecule. \\nA quantitative relationship between \\nreactants and products can be understood \\nfrom stoichiometry. Stoichiometry gives \\nthe numerical relationship between \\nchemical quantities in a balanced equation. \\nWhen a reaction is carried out using non-\\nstoichiometric quantities of the reactants, \\nthe product yield will be determined by \\nthe reactant that is completely consumed \\nand is called the limiting reagent. It limits \\nthe further reaction to take place. The \\nother reagent which is in excess is called \\nthe excess reagent.\\n  The reaction involving loss of \\nelectron is oxidation and gain of electron \\nis reduction. Usually both these reactions \\ntake place simultaneously and are called \\nas redox reactions. These redox reactions \\ncan be explained using oxidation number \\nconcept. Oxidation number is the \\nimaginary charge left on the atom when \\nall other atoms of the compound have \\n11th Std Chemistry 001-037.indd   2711th Std Chemistry 001-037.indd   27 23-12-2021   15:03:3123-12-2021   15:03:31'),\n",

We know that all \\nthings are made of matter. The basic \\nunit that makes up all matter is atom. \\nThe word ‘atom’ has been derived from \\nthe Greek word ‘ a-tomio’ meaning non-\\ndivisible. Atom was considered as non-\\ndivisible until the discovery of sub-\\natomic particles such as electron, proton \\nand neutron. J. J. Thomson’s cathode ray \\nexperiment revealed that atoms consist \\nof negatively charged particles called \\nelectrons. He proposed that atom is a \\npositively charged sphere in which the \\nelectrons are embedded like the seeds in \\nthe watermelon. Later, Rutherford’s α-ray \\nscattering experiment results proved that \\nThomson’s model was wrong. Rutherford \\nbombarded a thin gold foil with a stream \\nof fast moving α–particles. It was observed \\nthat\\n(i) most of the α–particles passed through \\nthe foil\\n(ii) some of them were deflected through \\na small angle and\\n(iii) very few α–particles were reflected \\nback by 180°\\nFigure. 2.1 Rutherford's α-ray scattering \\nexperiment\\n Based on these observations, he \\nproposed that in an atom there is a tiny \\npositively charged nucleus and the electrons \\nare moving around the nucleus with high \\nspeed. The theory of electromagnetic \\nradiation states that a moving charged \\nparticle should continuously loose its \\nenergy in the form of radiation. Therefore, \\nthe moving electron in an atom should \\ncontinuously loose its energy and finally \\ncollide with nucleus resulting in the \\ncollapse of the atom. However, this doesn't \\nhappen and the atoms are stable. Moreover, \\nthis model does not explain the distribution \\nof electrons around the nucleus and their \\nenergies. \\n2.1.1 Bohr atom model:\\n The work of Planck and Einstein \\nshowed that the energy of electromagnetic \\nradiation is quantised in units of hν \\n(where ν is the frequency of radiation and \\nh is Planck's constant 6.626 × 10 -34 Js). \\nExtending Planck’s quantum hypothesis \\nto the energies of atoms, Niels Bohr \\nproposed a new atomic model for the \\nhydrogen atom. This model is based on \\nthe following assumptions:\\n1. The energies of electrons in an atom \\nare quantised.\\n2.

J. J. Thomson proposed that \\nthe atom is a positively charged sphere \\nin which the electrons are embedded. \\nHowever, it fails to explain the stability \\nof atoms. Rutherford, based on his α-rays \\nscattering experiment, introduced the \\nterm nucleus which is a positively charged \\none and the negatively charged electrons \\nare revolving around it, at high speeds. \\nBohr modified the Rutherford theory and \\nintroduced stationary orbits by taking \\ninto account the quantisation of energy. \\nLouis de Broglie proposed that all matter \\npossess dual nature. i.e. they behave \\nboth as a wave and a particle. De Broglie \\nwavelength λ= =hm vh mev// 2  is \\nsignificant for a microscopic particle \\nsuch as an electron. The wave nature of \\nelectron is also proved by Davisson and \\nGermer through electron diffraction. For \\na microscopic particle such as an electron, \\nthe simultaneous measurement of the \\nconjugate variables such as position and \\nmomentum involves uncertainty which \\nis known as Heisenberg's uncertainty \\nprinciple and it is expressed as \\nΔx.Δp ≥ h/4 π. \\n De Broglie's concept and \\nHeisenberg's uncertainty principle lead to \\nthe development of quantum mechanical \\nmodel of atom. Erwin Schrodinger, \\ndeveloped an equation for an electron \\nwave which is expressed as Ĥψ = Eψ. \\nThis second order differential equation \\nis exactly solvable for one electron \\nsystem such as H, He + etc... but it is quite \\ncomplex for multi-electron systems. The \\nSchrÖdinger wave equation is solvable \\nfor certain energy values called eigen \\nvalues. The wave functions corresponding \\nto these eigen values are called atomic \\norbitals. The wave function ψ itself has no \\nphysical meaning. However, |ψ| 2 is related \\nto the probability of finding electron \\naround the nucleus. Thus the quantum \\nmechanical model introduced us the term \\norbital which is the three dimensional \\nspace in which the probability of finding \\nthe electron is maximum. The electron \\nin an orbital can be described by a set of \\nfour quantum numbers namely, principal \\nquantum number (n) representing the \\nprincipal energy level, azimuthal quantum \\nnumber ( l) representing the sub shell \\n(orbital), magnetic quantum number (m) \\nrepresenting the different orientation \\nof orbitals in space and spin quantum \\nnumber (s) representing the spinning of \\nelectron about its own axis. \\n The general solution of Schrodinger \\nfor a one electron system can be expressed \\nin spherical polar coordinates (r, θ, φ) \\nΨ (r, θ, φ) = R(r).f(θ).g(φ)\\n (where R(r) is called radial wave \\nfunction, other two functions are called \\nangular wave functions). \\n The plot of 4πr 2. R(r) 2 versus r \\ngives the radial distribution curves. The \\nnumber of radial nodes is given by(n- l-1) \\nwhereas the angular nodes is equal to \\nl. The angular distribution curve gives \\nthe boundary space diagram of orbital. \\n11th Std Chemistry 038-067.indd   5811th Std Chemistry 038-067.indd   58 23-12-2021   15:05:0123-12-2021   15:05:01\"),\n",

The relative energies of various \\norbitals are given by (n+ l) rule which \\nstates that, the lower the value of (n + l) \\nfor an orbital, the lower is its energy. If \\ntwo orbitals have the same value of (n + l), \\nthe orbital with lower value of n will have \\nthe lower energy. As per Pauli's exclusion \\nprinciple, the maximum number of \\nelectrons that can be accommodated in \\nan orbital is two. In the case of degenerate \\norbitals electron pairing does not take \\nplace until all the available degenerate \\norbitals contain one electron each. This \\nis known as Hund's rule. Based on these \\nprinciples, electronic configurations \\nof atoms can be written. In degenerate \\norbitals, the completely filled and half \\nfilled configurations are more stable than \\nthe partially filled configurations.

In stone age, man \\nhas used some metals to suit his needs \\nwithout knowing that they are elements. \\nSoon he learnt to extract elements from \\nores and fashion them into his daily life.  \\nOver the years, more and more elements \\nwere discovered. In 1789, Lavoisier from \\nFrance, published the first list of chemical \\nelements containing 23 elements after \\nseveral experimental investigations.  \\n Antoine Lavoisier classified the \\nsubstances into four groups of elements \\nnamely acid-making elements, gas-like \\nelements, metallic elements and earthy \\nelements \\nTable 3.1 Lavoisier table  \\nacid-making  \\nelements gas-like elements\\nsulphur light\\nphosphorus caloric (heat)\\ncharcoal (carbon) oxygen\\nazote (nitrogen)\\nhydrogen\\nmetallic elements earthy elements\\ncobalt, mercury, tin lime (calcium \\noxide)\\ncopper, nickel, iron magnesia (magne-\\nsium oxide)\\ngold, lead, silver, zinc barytes (barium \\nsulphate)\\nmanganese, tungten argilla (aluminium \\noxide)\\nplatina (platinum) silex (silicon diox-\\nide)\\n3.1 Classification of Elements  \\n During the 19 th century, scientists \\nhave isolated several elements and the list \\nof known elements increased. Currently, \\nwe have 118 known elements.  Out of \\n118 elements, 92 elements with atomic \\nnumbers 1 to 92 are found in nature. \\nScientists have found out there are some \\nsimilarities in properties among certain \\nelements. This observation has led to the \\nidea of classification of elements based on \\ntheir properties. In fact, classification will \\nbe beneficial for the effective utilization \\nof these elements.  Several attempts were \\nmade to classify the elements. However, \\nclassification based on the atomic weights \\nled to the construction of a proper form of \\nperiodic table. \\n In 1817, J. W . Döbereiner classified \\nsome elements such as chlorine, bromine \\nand iodine with similar chemical properties \\ninto the group of three elements called \\nas triads. In triads, the atomic weight of \\nthe middle element nearly equal to the \\narithmetic mean of the atomic weights \\nof the remaining two elements. However, \\nonly a limited number of elements can be \\ngrouped as triads. \\n11th Std Chemistry 068-099.indd   6911th Std Chemistry 068-099.indd   69 23-12-2021   15:10:1023-12-2021   15:10:10'),\n",

E. B. de Chancourtois \\nreported a correlation between the \\nproperties of the elements and their atomic \\nweights. He said ‘the properties of bodies \\nare the properties of numbers’ . He intended \\nthe term numbers to mean the value of \\natomic weights. He designed a helix by \\ntracing at an angle 45˚ to the vertical axis of \\na cylinder with circumference of 16 units. \\nHe arranged the elements in the increasing \\natomic weights along the helix on the \\nsurface of this cylinder.  One complete \\nturn of a helix corresponds to an atomic \\nweight increase of 16. Elements which lie \\non the 16 equidistant vertical lines drawn \\non the surface of cylinder shows similar \\nproperties. This was the first reasonable \\nattempt towards the creation of periodic \\ntable. However, it did not attract much \\nattention.\\n In 1864, J. Newland made an attempt \\nto classify the elements and proposed the \\nlaw of octaves. On arranging the elements \\nin the increasing order of atomic weights, \\nhe observed that the properties of every \\neighth element are similar to the properties \\nof the first element. This law holds good \\nfor lighter elements up to calcium. \\nTable 3.3 Newlands’ Octaves\\n7Li 9Be 11B 12C 14N 16O 19F\\n23Na 24Mg 27Al 29Si 31P 32S 35.5Cl\\n39K 40Ca\\n3.1.1 Mendeleev's Classification\\n In 1868, Lothar Meyer had \\ndeveloped a table of the elements that \\nclosely resembles the modern periodic \\ntable. He plotted the physical properties \\nsuch as atomic volume, melting point and \\nboiling point against atomic weight and \\nobserved a periodical pattern. \\n During same period Dmitri \\nMendeleev independently proposed that \\n“the properties of the elements are the \\nperiodic functions of their atomic weights” \\nand this is called periodic law. Mendeleev \\nlisted 70 elements, which were known \\ntill histime in several vertical columns in \\norder of increasing atomic weights.  Thus, \\nMendeleev constructed the first periodic \\ntable based on the periodic la w. \\n11th Std Chemistry 068-099.indd   7011th Std Chemistry 068-099.indd   70 23-12-2021   15:10:1023-12-2021   15:10:10\"),\n",

The placement of element in the periodic table is \\nclosely related to its outer shell electronic configuration. Let us analyse the change in the \\nelectronic configuration of elements along the periods and down the groups.\\n3.4.1 Variation of Electronic Configuration along the periods\\n We have already learnt that each period starts with the element having general outer \\nelectronic configuration ns 1 and ends with ns2, np6 where n is the period number. The first \\nperiod starts with the filling of valence electrons in 1s orbital, which can accommodate \\nonly two electrons.  Hence, the first period has two elements, namely hydrogen and \\nhelium. The second period starts with the filling of valence electrons in 2s orbital followed \\nby three 2p orbitals with eight elements from lithium to neon. The third period starts with \\nfilling of valence electrons in the 3s orbital followed by 3p orbitals. The fourth period \\nstarts with filling of valence electrons from 4s orbital followed by 3d and 4p orbitals in \\naccordance with Aufbau principle. Similarly, we can explain the electronic configuration \\nof elements in the subsequent periods (Table 3.10). \\n11th Std Chemistry 068-099.indd   7611th Std Chemistry 068-099.indd   76 23-12-2021   15:10:1223-12-2021   15:10:12'),\n",

These 10 elements are called first transition series. Similarly 4d, 5d and 6d orbitals \\nare filled in successive periods and the corresponding series of elements are called second, \\nthird and fourth transition series respectively. \\n In the sixth period the filling of valence electrons starts with 6s orbital followed by \\n4f, 5d and 6p orbitals. The filling up of 4f orbitals begins with Cerium (Z=58) and ends \\nat Lutetium (Z=71).  These 14 elements constitute the first inner-transition series called \\nLanthanides. Similarly, in the seventh period 5f orbitals are filled, and it's -14 elements \\nconstitute the second inner-transition series called Actinides. These two series are placed \\nseparately at the bottom of the modern periodic table.\\n3.4.2 Variation of Electronic Configuration in the Groups: \\n Elements of a group have similar electronic configuration in the outer shell. The \\ngeneral outer electronic configurations for the 18 groups are listed in the Table 3.11. The \\ngroups can be combined as s, p, d and f block elements on the basis of the orbital in which \\nthe last valence electron enters. \\n The elements of group 1 and group 2 are called s-block elements, since the last \\nvalence electron enters the ns orbital. The group 1 elements are called alkali metals while \\nthe group 2 elements are called alkaline earth metals. These are soft metals and possess \\nlow melting and boiling points with low ionisation enthalpies. They are highly reactive \\nand form ionic compounds. They are highly electropositive in nature and most of the \\nelements imparts colour to the flame. We will study the properties of these group elements \\nin detail in subsequent chapters. \\n11th Std Chemistry 068-099.indd   7711th Std Chemistry 068-099.indd   77 23-12-2021   15:10:1223-12-2021   15:10:12\"),\n",

The elements of 18th \\ngroup contain completely filled valence shell electronic configuration (ns 2, np6) and are \\ncalled inert gases or nobles gases.

The \\nsimplest method proposed by Schomaker \\nand Stevenson is as follows.\\n d A-B = rA + rB - 0.09 ( χA-χB)\\n where χA and χB are the \\nelectronegativities of A and B respectively \\nin Pauling units. Here χA > χB and radius is \\nin Å.\\n Let us calculate the covalent radius \\nof hydrogen using the experimental d H-Cl \\nvalue is 1.28 Å and the covalent radius \\nof chlorine is 0.99 Å.

As we move from left to right \\nalong a period, the valence electrons are \\nadded to the same shell. The simultaneous \\naddition of protons to the nucleus, \\nincreases the nuclear charge, as well as \\nthe electrostatic attractive force between \\nthe valence electrons and the nucleus. \\nTherefore atomic radius decreases along a \\nperiod.\\nEffective nuclear charge\\n In addition to the electrostatic \\nforces of attraction between the nucleus \\nand the electrons, there exists repulsive \\nforces among the electrons. The repulsive \\nforce between the inner shell electrons and \\nthe valence electrons leads to a decrease in  \\nthe electrostatic attractive forces acting on \\nthe valence electrons by the nucleus. Thus, \\nthe inner shell electrons act as a shield \\nbetween the nucleus and the valence \\nelectrons.

The plot of atomic number vs \\nionisation energy is given below.\\n In the following graph, there are \\ntwo deviation in the trends of ionisiation \\nenergy. It is expected that boron has higher \\nionisation energy than beryllium since it \\nhas higher nuclear charge. However, the \\nactual  ionisation energies of beryllium \\nand boron are 899 and 800 kJ mol -1 \\nrespectively contrary to the expectation. \\nIt is due to the fact that beryllium with \\ncompletely filled 2s orbital, is more stable \\nthan partially filled valence shell electronic \\nconfiguration of boron.

Since the half \\nfilled electronic configuration is more \\nstable, it requires higher energy to remove \\nan electron from 2p orbital of nitrogen. \\nWhereas the removal one 2p electron \\nfrom oxygen leads to a stable half filled \\nconfiguration. This makes comparatively \\neasier to remove 2p electron from oxygen. \\nPeriodic variation in group\\n The ionisation energy decreases \\ndown a group. As we move down a group, \\nthe valence electron occupies new shells, \\nthe distance between the nucleus and the \\nvalence electron increases. So, the nuclear \\nforces of attraction on valence electron \\ndecreases and hence ionisation energy \\nalso decreases down a group.\\nIonisation energy and shielding effect\\n As we move down a group, the \\nnumber of inner shell electron increases \\nwhich in turn increases the repulsive force \\nexerted by them on the valence electrons, \\ni.e. the increased shielding effect caused by \\nthe inner electrons decreases the attractive \\nforce acting on the valence electron by the \\nnucleus. Therefore the ionisation energy \\ndecreases.\\n Let us understand this trend by \\nconsidering the ionisation energy of alkali \\nmetals.\\nFigure 3.3 Variation of Ionisation energy  \\ndown the I Group.\\nIonisation energy in kJ mol-1\\nAtomic number\\nLi\\nNa\\nK\\nRb\\nCs\\n600\\n550\\n500\\n450\\n400\\n350\\n300\\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\\n11th Std Chemistry 068-099.indd   8511th Std Chemistry 068-099.indd   85 23-12-2021   15:10:1523-12-2021   15:10:15'),\n",

However, a number \\nof scales are available to calculate its \\nvalue. One such method was developed \\nby Pauling, he  assigned arbitrary value \\nof electronegativities for hydrogen and \\nfluorine as 2.1 and 4.0 respectively. Based \\non this the electronegativity values for \\nother elements can be calculated using the \\nfollowing expression\\n (χ A – χB ) = 0.182 √EAB – (EAAxEBB)½\\n Where E AB, E AA and E BB are the \\nbond dissociation energies (K cal)  of AB, \\nA2 and B2 molecules respectively. \\n The electronegativity of any given \\nelement is not a constant and its value \\ndepends on the element to which it is \\ncovalently bound. The electronegativity \\nvalues play an important role in predicting \\nthe nature of the bond. \\nVariation of Electronegativity in a \\nperiod:\\n The electronegativity generally \\nincreases across a period from left to right. \\nAs discussed earlier, the atomic radius \\ndecreases in a period, as the attraction \\nbetween the valence electron and the \\nnucleus increases. Hence the tendency to \\nattract shared pair of electrons increases. \\nTherefore, electronegativity also increases \\nin a period\\nFigure 3.6 Variation of Electronegativity \\nalong II period\\nElectronegativity values (Paulings Scale)\\n4.5\\n4\\n3.5\\n3\\n2.5\\n2\\n1.5\\n1\\n0.5\\n0\\nAtomic Number\\n0 2 4 6 8 10\\nLi\\nBe\\nB\\nC\\nN\\nO\\nF\\n11th Std Chemistry 068-099.indd   8711th Std Chemistry 068-099.indd   87 23-12-2021   15:10:1523-12-2021   15:10:15'),\n",

As the number of valence electrons remains same for the elements in same \\ngroup, the maximum valence also remains the same.

However, the first element of each group differs from other members of the \\ngroup in certain properties. For example, lithium and beryllium form more covalent \\ncompounds, unlike the alkali and alkaline earth metals which predominantly form ionic \\ncompounds. The elements of the second period have only four orbitals (2s & 2p) in the \\nvalence shell and have a maximum co-valence of 4, whereas the other members of the \\nsubsequent periods have more orbitals in their valence shell and shows higher valences. \\nFor example, boron forms BF 4\\n–and aluminium forms AlF 6\\n3–\\n11th Std Chemistry 068-099.indd   8911th Std Chemistry 068-099.indd   89 23-12-2021   15:10:1523-12-2021   15:10:15'),\n",

The elements on the \\nleft side of the periodic table have less \\nionisation energy and readily lose their \\nvalence electrons. On the other hand, the \\nelements on right side of the periodic table \\nhave high electron affinity and readily \\naccept electrons. As a consequence of \\nthis, elements of these extreme ends show \\nhigh reactivity when compared to the \\nelements present in the middle. The noble \\ngases having completely filled electronic \\nconfiguration neither accept nor lose \\ntheir electron readily and hence they are \\nchemically inert in nature. \\n The ionisation energy is directly \\nrelated to the metallic character and the \\nelements located in the lower left portion \\nof the periodic table have less ionisation \\nenergy and therefore show metallic \\ncharacter. On the other hand the elements \\nlocated in the top right portion have \\nvery high ionisation energy and are non-\\nmetallic in nature. \\n Let us analyse the nature of the \\ncompounds formed by elements from \\nboth sides of the periodic table. Consider \\nthe reaction of alkali metals and halogens \\nwith oxygen to give the corresponding \\noxides. \\n4 Na + O 2 → 2 Na 2O\\n2 Cl2 + 7 O 2 → 2 Cl2O7\\n Since sodium oxide reacts with \\nwater to give strong base sodium \\nhydroxide, it is a basic oxide. Conversely \\nCl2O7 gives strong acid called perchloric \\nacid upon reaction with water So, it is an \\nacidic oxide.  \\nNa2O + H2O → 2NaOH\\nCl2O7 + H2O → 2 HClO 4 \\n Thus, the elements from the two \\nextreme ends of the periodic table behave \\ndifferently as expected. \\n As we move down the group, \\nthe ionisation energy decreases and the \\nelectropositive character of elements \\nincreases. Hence, the hydroxides of \\nthese elements become more basic.

This followed by Johann \\nDobereiner,  A. E. B. de Chancourtois and \\nNewlands. First meaningful periodic table \\nwas constructed by Mendeleeve based on \\natomic mass. This was later modified based \\non the modern periodic law which states \\nthat the properties of elements are the \\nperiodic functions of their atomic numbers. \\nThe modern periodic table is made up of 18 \\ngroups and 7 periods. \\n The elements in the same groups have \\nsimilar properties because their valence shell \\nelectronic configurations are similar.  The \\nproperties of the elements of the same period \\ndiffer because they have different valence \\nshell electronic configurations. On the basis \\nof electronic configuration the elements are \\nalso classified as s-block, p-block, d-block and \\nf-block elements.  The elements belonging to \\n“s, p, d and f ” blocks have unique characteristic \\nproperties.  In this table, more than 78% of \\nall known elements are metals.  They appear \\non the left side of the periodic table.  Non-\\nmetals are located at the top right hand side \\nof the periodic table.  Some elements show \\nproperties that are characteristic of both \\nmetals and non-metals and are called semi-\\nmetals or metalloids.\\n The periodic properties such as atomic \\nradius, ionic radius, ionization enthalpy, \\nelectron gain enthalpy, electronegativity are \\npossessing periodic trends. The variations of \\nthese properties are described in the following \\nscheme.\\n The elements at the extreme left \\nexhibit strong reducing property whereas the \\nelements at extreme right strong oxidizing \\nproperty.

In \\ncontrast to other elements (except helium) \\nits valence electron is directly in the sphere of \\naction of the nucleus. It is invariably present \\nin most of the compounds we come across \\nin our daily life such as water, carbohydrate, \\nproteins etc.  As it has an unpaired electron, it \\nis reactive and exists as a diatomic molecule \\n(H2). However, the abundance of hydrogen \\ngas in the earth’s atmosphere is very small. \\n4.1.1 Position in Periodic Table \\n  The hydrogen has the electronic \\nconfiguration of 1s 1 which resembles with \\nns1 general valence shell configuration of \\nalkali metals and shows similarity with them \\nas follows: \\n1. It forms unipositive ion (H +) like alkali \\nmetals (Na+, K+, Cs+) \\n2. It forms halides (HX), oxides (H 2O), \\nperoxides (H 2O2) and sulphides (H 2S) \\nlike alkali metals (NaX, Na 2O, Na 2O2, \\nNa2S)\\n3. It also acts as a reducing agent.\\n  However, unlike alkali metals which \\nhave ionization energy ranging from 377 to \\n520 kJ mol-1, the hydrogen has 1,314 KJ mol-1  \\nwhich is much higher than alkali metals. \\n  Like the formation of halides (X -) \\nfrom halogens, hydrogen also has a tendency \\nto gain one electron to form hydride ion \\n(H-) whose electronic configuration is \\nsimilar to the noble gas, helium. However, \\nthe electron affinity of hydrogen is much \\nless than that of halogen atoms. Hence, the \\ntendency of hydrogen to form hydride ion \\nis low compared to that of halogens to form \\nthe halide ions as evident from the following \\nreactions:\\n ½ H2 + e- →  H-      ΔH = + 36 kcal mol-1\\n ½ Br2 + e- → Br-      ΔH = - 55 kcal mol-1 \\n  Since, hydrogen has similarities \\nwith alkali metals as well as the halogens; \\nit is difficult to find the right position in \\nthe periodic table. However, in most of its \\ncompounds hydrogen exists in +1 oxidation \\nstate. Therefore, it is reasonable to place \\nthe hydrogen in group 1 along with alkali \\nmetals as shown in the latest periodic table \\npublished by IUPAC.   \\n4.1.2 Isotopes of Hydrogen  \\n  Hydrogen has three naturally \\noccurring isotopes, viz., protium (1H1 or H), \\ndeuterium ( 1H2 or D) and tritium ( 1H3 or \\nT). Protium (1H1) is the predominant form \\n(99.985 %) and it is the only isotope that \\ndoes not contain a neutron.  \\n      \\nFigure 4.1 Isotopes of hydrogen\\n  Deuterium, also known as heavy \\nhydrogen, constitutes about 0.015 %.  The \\nthird isotope, tritium is a radioactive isotope \\nof hydrogen which occurs only in traces \\n(~1 atom per 10 18 hydrogen atoms). Due \\nto the existence of these isotopes naturally \\noccurring hydrogen exists as H 2, HD, D 2, \\nHT, T 2, and DT. The properties of these \\nisotopes are shown in Table 4.1.\\nProtium\\nTritiumDeuterium\\n11th Std Chemistry 100-124.indd   10111th Std Chemistry 100-124.indd   101 23-12-2021   15:14:2123-12-2021   15:14:21'),\n",

These two forms of hydrogen molecules are called ortho and para \\nhydrogens respectively. \\nPara-hydrogenOrtho-hydrogen\\n  At room temperature, normal hydrogen consists of about 75% ortho-form and 25% para-\\nform.  As the ortho-form is more stable than para-form, the conversion of one isomer into the \\nother is a slow process.  However, the equilibrium shifts in favour of para hydrogen when the \\ntemperature is lowered.  The para-form can be catalytically transformed into ortho-form using \\nplatinum or iron.  Alternatively, it can also be converted by passing an electric discharge, heating \\nabove 800°C and mixing with paramagnetic molecules such as O2, NO, NO2 or with nascent/atomic  \\nhydrogen. \\n11th Std Chemistry 100-124.indd   10211th Std Chemistry 100-124.indd   102 23-12-2021   15:14:2123-12-2021   15:14:21'),\n",

When hard water is boiled carbonates \\nof magnesium and calcium present in it gets \\nprecipitated. On the other hand, water free \\nfrom soluble salts of calcium and magnesium \\nis called soft water. The hardness of water is \\nof two types, viz., temporary hardness and \\npermanent hardness.\\nTemporary Hardness and its removal: \\n Temporary hardness is primarily \\ndue to the presence of soluble bicarbonates \\nof magnesium and calcium. This can be \\nremoved by boiling the hard water followed \\nby filtration. Upon boiling, these salts \\ndecompose into insoluble carbonate which \\nleads to their precipitation. The magnesium \\ncarbonate thus formed further hydrolysed \\nto give insoluble magnesium hydroxide.  \\nCa(HCO3)2 → CaCO3 + H2O  + CO2 \\nMg(HCO3)2 → MgCO3  + H2O + CO2 \\nMgCO3 + H2O → Mg(OH)2  +  CO2 \\n The resulting precipitates can be \\nremoved by filtration. \\n Alternatively, we can use Clark’s \\nmethod in which, calculated amount of \\nlime is added to hard water containing the \\nmagnesium and calcium, and the resulting \\ncarbonates and hydroxides can be filtered-\\noff. \\nCa(HCO3)2 +  Ca(OH )2 →  2CaCO3 + 2H2O \\nMg (HCO3)2 + 2 Ca(OH )2\\n↓   \\n2CaCO3  + Mg(OH)2 +2 H2O \\nPermanent Hardness:  \\n Permanent hardness of water is due \\nto the presence of soluble salts of magnesium \\nand calcium in the form of chlorides and \\nsulphates in it.  It can be removed by adding \\nwashing soda, which reacts with these metal \\n(M = Ca or Mg) chlorides and sulphates in \\nhard water to form insoluble carbonates.\\nMCl2 + Na2CO3 → MCO3 + 2 NaCl\\nMSO4 + Na2CO3 → MCO3 + Na2SO4 \\n In another  way to  soften the hard \\nwater is by using a process called ion-\\nexchange. That is, hardness can be removed \\nby passing through an ion-exchange bed \\nlike zeolites or column containing ion-\\nexchange resin. Zeolites are hydrated \\nsodium alumino-silicates with a general \\nformula, Na2O∙Al2O3∙xSiO2∙yH2O ( x = 2 to \\n10, y = 2 to 6).

It also forms ternary \\nhydrides with two metals. E.g., LiBH 4 and \\nLiAlH4. The hydrides  are classified as ionic, \\ncovalent and metallic hydrides according \\nto the nature of bonding. Hydrides formed \\nwith elements having lower electronegativity \\nthan hydrogen are often ionic, whereas with \\nelements having higher electronegativity \\nthan hydrogen form covalent hydrides. \\n Ionic (Saline) hydrides : These are \\nhydrides composed of an electropositive \\nmetal, generally, an\\xa0alkali\\xa0or\\xa0alkaline-earth \\nmetal, except beryllium and magnesium, \\nformed by transfer of electrons from metal \\nto hydrogen atoms.  They can be prepared \\nby the reaction of elements at about 400 ° \\nC.  These are salt-like, high-melting, white \\ncrystalline solids having hydride ions (H −) \\nand metal cations (Mn+).  \\n2 Li + H2 → 2 LiH\\n2 Ca + 2H2  → 2 CaH2  \\n Covalent (Molecular) hydrides :  \\nThey are compounds in which hydrogen \\nis attached to another element by sharing \\nof electrons.  The most common examples \\nof covalent hydrides of non-metals are \\nmethane, ammonia, water and hydrogen \\nchloride.  Covalent hydrides are further \\ndivided into three categories, viz., electron \\nprecise (CH4, C 2H6, SiH 4, GeH 4), electron-\\ndeficient (B2H6) and electron-rich hydrides \\n(NH3, H 2O).  Since most of the covalent \\nhydrides consist of discrete, small molecules \\nthat have relatively weak intermolecular \\nforces, they are generally gases or volatile \\nliquids.  \\n Metallic (Interstitial) hydrides :  \\nMetallic hydrides are usually obtained by \\nhydrogenation of metals and alloys in which \\nhydrogen occupies the interstitial sites \\n(voids).  Hence, they are called interstitial \\nhydrides; the hydrides show properties \\nsimilar to parent metals and hence they \\nare also known as metallic hydrides. Most \\nof the hydrides are non-stoichiometric \\nwith variable composition (TiH 1.5-1.8 and                  \\nPdH0.6-0.8), some are relatively light, \\ninexpensive and thermally unstable which \\nmake them useful for hydrogen storage \\napplications.  Electropositive metals and \\nsome other metals form hydrides with the \\nstoichiometry MH or sometimes MH2\\xa0(M = \\nTi, Zr, Hf, V , Zn).  \\n4.9 Hydrogen Bonding\\n Hydrogen bonding is one of the most \\nimportant natural phenomena occurring \\nin chemical and biological sciences. \\nThese interactions play a major role in the \\n11th Std Chemistry 100-124.indd   11311th Std Chemistry 100-124.indd   113 23-12-2021   15:14:2523-12-2021   15:14:25'),\n",

When a \\nhydrogen atom (H) is covalently bonded \\nto a highly electronegative atom such as \\nfluorine (F) or oxygen\\xa0(O) or\\xa0nitrogen\\xa0(N), \\nthe bond is polarized. Due to this effect, the \\npolarized hydrogen atom is able to form a \\nweak electrostatic interaction with another \\nelectronegative atom present in the vicinity.  \\nThis interaction is called as a hydrogen bond \\n(20-50 kJ mol −1) and is denoted by dotted \\nlines (…).  \\n It is weaker than covalent bond (> \\n100 kJ mol−1) but stronger than the van der \\nWaals interaction (< 20 kJ mol−1).  Hydrogen \\nbond has profound effect on various physical \\nproperties including vapour pressure (H 2O \\nand H 2S), boiling point, miscibility of \\nliquids (H2O and C2H5OH), surface tension, \\ndensities, viscosity, heat of vaporization and \\nfusion, etc.   Hydrogen bonds\\xa0 can occur \\nwithin a molecule ( intramolecular hydrogen \\nbonding) and between two molecules of the \\nsame type or different type ( intermolecular \\nhydrogen bonding).\\nIntramolecular Hydrogen Bond\\nIntramolecular hydrogen bonds are \\nthose which occur within a single molecule. \\n=\\n=\\nO\\nHO OO C\\nN O\\nH H\\nHydrogen bond Hydrogen bond\\nOrtho-Nitrophenol Salicilaldehyde\\nFigure 4.6 Intramolecular hydrogen \\nbonding\\nIntermolecular hydrogen bond\\nIntermolecular hydrogen bonds occur \\nbetween two separate molecules.

For \\nexample, intermolecular hydrogen bonds can \\noccur between\\xa0ammonia molecule themselves \\nor between\\xa0 water molecules themselves or \\nbetween\\xa0ammonia and water.  \\nWater molecules form strong \\nhydrogen bonds with one another.  For \\nexample, each water molecule is linked to \\nfour others through hydrogen bonds.  The \\nshorter distances (100 pm) correspond to \\ncovalent bonds (solid lines), and the longer \\ndistances (180 pm) correspond to hydrogen \\nbonds (dotted lines).  \\nIn ice, each atom is surrounded \\ntetrahedrally by four water molecules through \\nhydrogen bonds.  That is, the presence of two \\nhydrogen atoms and two lone pairs of electron \\non oxygen atoms in each water molecule allows \\nformation of a three-dimensional structure. \\nThis arrangement creates an open structure, \\nwhich accounts for the lower density of ice \\ncompared with water at 0°C.

Upon heating, H atoms diffuse through \\nthe metal to the surface and recombine to form \\nmolecular hydrogen.  Since no other gas behaves \\nthis way with palladium, this process has been \\nused to separate hydrogen gas from other gases: \\n2 Pd (s) + H 2 (g) → 2 PdH (s).  \\nThe hydrogen molecule readily adsorb on the palladium surface, where it dissociates \\ninto atomic hydrogen.  The dissociated atoms dissolve into the interstices or voids \\n(octahedral/tetrahedral) of the crystal lattice. \\nTechnically, the formation of metal hydride is by chemical reaction but it behaves like \\na physical storage method, i.e., it is absorbed and released like a water sponge.  Such \\na reversible uptake of hydrogen in metals and alloys is also attractive for hydrogen \\nstorage and for rechargeable metal hydride battery applications.\\nThe Hydrogen – Future Fuel\\n The depletion of fossil fuel \\nreserves and the threat of global \\nwarming make the world to \\nshift toward alternative fuels.  In this regard, \\nhydrogen is often considered as a potential \\ncandidate for this purpose as it is a clean burning \\nfuel as it does not produce any pollutants upon \\nburning. Hence, hydrogen can directly be used \\nas a fuel and can replace existing gasoline \\n(petrol)/diesel/kerosene powered engines, and/\\nor indirectly be used with oxygen in fuel cells to generate electricity.

It has \\nthree isotopes namely protium, deuterium \\nand tritium. The hydrogen exists as diatomic \\ngaseous molecule. The molecule has two \\nnuclear spin isomers namely ortho and para-\\nhydrogen. Elemental hydrogen having an \\nelectronic configuration of 1s 1, has properties \\nsimilar to alkali metals as well as halogens. \\nBased on its electronic configuration and \\nexistence of the +1 oxidation state in most of \\nthe compounds it is placed in group 1 along \\nwith alkali metals. \\n Hydrogen is prepared by the action \\nof metal with mineral acids in laboratory. In \\nindustrial scale, hydrogen is produced by the \\nsteam-reforming  of hydrocarbons. Deuterium \\ncan be synthesized by the electrolysis of \\nheavy water, while the radioactive tritium \\nis prepared by the nuclear transmutation \\nreaction of lithium with slow neutrons. \\n Hydrogen reacts with nonmetals \\nlike oxygen and halogens to form water and \\nhydrogen halides respectively. It reacts with \\nmetals to form metal hydrides. It acts as \\ngood reducing agent. Deuterium undergoes \\nexchange reactions with hydrogen. Tritium \\nwith a half-life period of 12.3 years and emits \\nβ-particles spontaneously. Hydrogen has \\nmany uses including in the preparation of \\nammonia, methanol, and hydrogenation of \\noils and reduction of metal oxides. It can also \\nbe used as fuel. \\n Water is an important amphoteric \\noxide of hydrogen and used a universal \\nsolvent. It hydrolyses oxides and forms metal \\nhydroxides with metals such as sodium and \\nbarium. Due to the presence of soluble salts \\nof calcium and magnesium in water, the \\nwater shows hardness. Clark's method can \\nbe used to remove temporary hardness. Like \\nwater, another important oxide is hydrogen \\nperoxide. It is used as a mild antiseptic and \\nas a bleaching agent in textile and paper \\nindustries. Hydrogen bound to strong \\nelectronegative atoms such as fluorine, \\nnitrogen or oxygen atoms, forms a peculiar \\ntype of electrostatic interactions with another \\nstrong electronegative atom. This is called \\nhydrogen bond. This is one of important \\ninteractions observed in many biological \\nmolecules such as proteins, DNA etc…\\n11th Std Chemistry 100-124.indd   11811th Std Chemistry 100-124.indd   118 23-12-2021   15:14:2723-12-2021   15:14:27\"),\n",

Lithium forms only \\nmonoxide, sodium forms the monoxide \\nand peroxide and the other elements form \\nmonoxide, peroxide, and superoxides. \\nThese oxides are basic in nature.\\n4 Li +O 2      2Li2O (simple oxide)\\n2 Na +O 2  Na2O2  (peroxide)\\nM + O2  MO2  (superoxide)\\n(M= K, Rb,Cs) \\nReaction with hydrogen\\n  All alkali metals react with \\nhydrogen at about 673 K (lithium at \\n1073 K) to form the corresponding ionic \\nhydrides.

The hydrides behave as strong \\nreducing agents and their reducing nature \\nincreases down the group.\\nReaction with halogen\\n  Alkali metals combine readily \\nwith halogens to form ionic halides MX. \\nReactivity of alkali metals with halogens \\nincreases down the group because of \\ncorresponding decrease in ionisation \\nenthalpy.\\n2M + X 2   2 MX  \\n(M= Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) (X= F , Cl, Br, I)\\n  All metal halides are ionic crystals.  \\nHowever Lithium iodide shows covalent \\ncharacter, as it is the smallest cation that \\nexerts high polarising power on the  iodide \\nanion. Additionally, the iodide ion being \\nthe largest can be polarised to a greater \\nextent by Li + ion.\\nReaction with liquid ammonia: \\n  Alkali metals dissolve in liquid \\nammonia to give deep blue solutions \\nthat are conducting in nature. The \\nconductivity is similar to that of pure \\nmetals (The specific conductivity of Hg is \\n104 Ω-1 and for sodium in liquid ammonia \\nis 0.5 x 10 4 Ω-1).

The \\nperoxides are diamagnetic while the \\nsuperoxides are paramagnetic. Sodium \\nperoxide is widely used as an oxidising \\nagent. The hydroxides which are obtained \\nby the reaction of the oxides with water \\nare all white crystalline solids. The alkali \\nmetal hydroxides are strong bases.

They \\ncan be prepared by the reaction of the \\nappropriate oxide, hydroxide or carbonate \\nwith aqueous hydrohalic acid (HX). As the \\nelectropositive character of alkali metal \\nincreases from Li to Cs, the ease with \\nwhich the metals form halides increases \\nfrom Li to Cs. All halides are ionic in \\nnature except LiBr and LiI. Except LiF , \\nall other  halides are soluble in water. The \\nlow solubility of LiF in water is due to its \\nhigh lattice enthalpy (small size of Li + and \\nF-). Due to the presence of covalent nature \\nboth LiBr and LiI are soluble in organic \\nsolvents.\\nSalts of oxo-acids\\n  Alkali metals form salts with all the \\noxo-acids.

It is prepared by Solvay process. \\nIn this process, ammonia is converted \\ninto ammonium carbonate which then \\nconverted to ammonium bicarbonate by \\npassing excess carbon dioxide in a sodium \\nchloride solution saturated with ammonia. \\nThe ammonium bicarbonate thus formed \\nreacts with the sodium chloride to give \\nsodium bicarbonate and ammonium \\nchloride. As sodium bicarbonate has poor \\nsolubility, it gets precipitated. The sodium \\nbicarbonate is isolated and is heated to \\ngive sodium carbonate. The equations  \\ninvolved in this process are,\\n2NH3 + H2O + CO 2 → (NH4)2CO3\\n(NH4)2CO3  + H2O + CO 2 → 2 NH4HCO3 \\nNH4HCO3 + NaCl  → NH4Cl + NaHCO 3\\n2 NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + CO2 + H2O \\n  The ammonia used in this process \\ncan be recovered by treating the resultant \\nammonium chloride solution with calcium \\nhydroxide.  Calcium chloride is formed as \\na by-product. \\nProperties: \\n  Sodium carbonate, commonly \\nknown as washing soda, crystallises as \\ndecahydrate which is white in colour. It \\nis soluble in water and forms an alkaline \\nsolution. Upon heating, it looses the water \\nof crystallisation to form monohydrate. \\nAbove 373 K, the monohydrate becomes \\ncompletely anhydrous and changes to a \\nwhite powder called soda ash. \\nNa2CO3·10H2O → Na2CO3·H2O + 9H 2O\\nNa2CO3·H2O → Na2CO3 + H2O \\nUses:\\ni.

A typical 70 kg man \\ncontains about 90 g of sodium and 170 g \\nof potassium compared with only 5 g of \\niron and 0.06 g of copper. \\n  Sodium ions are found primarily \\non the outside of cells, being located \\nin blood plasma and in the interstitial \\nfluid which surrounds the cells. These \\nions participate in the transmission of \\nnerve signals, in regulating the flow of \\nwater across cell membranes and in the \\ntransport of sugars and amino acids into \\ncells. Sodium and potassium, although so \\nsimilar chemically, differ quantitatively in \\ntheir ability to penetrate cell membranes, \\nin their transport mechanisms and in \\ntheir efficiency to activate enzymes. Thus, \\npotassium ions are the most abundant \\ncations within cell fluids, where they \\nactivate many enzymes, participate in \\nthe oxidation of glucose to produce ATP \\nand, with sodium, are responsible for the \\ntransmission of nerve signals. \\n Sodium–potassium pump play an \\nimportant role in transmitting nerve signals.  \\nFigure 5.4 Sodium–potassium pump\\n5.5 Alkaline earth metals\\n  Group 2 in the modern periodic \\ntable contains the elements beryllium, \\nmagnesium, calcium, strontium, barium \\nand radium.

They are called \\nso because the valence electron occupies \\nthe s orbitals. The group 1 elements have \\na general outer electronic configuration \\nns1 and are called alkali metals. The \\ngroup 2 elements have a general outer \\nelectronic configuration ns 2 and these \\nare called alkaline earth metals as they \\nare found in earth’s crust and their oxides \\nand hydroxides are alkaline in nature. \\nElements belonging to group 1 and 2 are \\nhighly reactive and forms M + and M 2+ \\ncations respectively. Their physical and \\nchemical properties of both groups show \\na regular trend as we move down the \\ngroup. The atomic and ionic radii increase \\nas we move down the group while their \\nionisation enthalpies decrease.\\n The first element in each of these \\ngroups, lithium in Group 1 and beryllium \\nin Group 2 shows some difference in \\nbehaviour with the elements in rest of their \\ngroups and show similarities in properties \\nto the second member of the next group. \\nThis behaviour is known as the ‘diagonal \\nrelationship’ in the periodic table. \\n The alkali metals are soft and \\nsilvery white in colour with low melting \\npoints. They are highly reactive. \\nThe compounds of alkali metals are \\npredominantly ionic. They form metal \\nhydrides and halides with hydrogen and \\nhalogens respectively. Their oxides and \\nhydroxides are soluble in water forming \\nstrong alkalies. Important compounds of \\nsodium include sodium carbonate, sodium \\nchloride, sodium hydroxide and sodium \\nhydrogen carbonate. Sodium hydroxide is \\nmanufactured by Castner-Kellner process \\nand sodium carbonate by Solvay process.\\n The chemistry of alkaline earth \\nmetals is similar to alkali metals. \\nHowever, we observe some differences \\nbecause of their reduced atomic and ionic \\nsizes and increased cationic charges. \\nTheir oxides and hydroxides are less \\nbasic than the alkali metal oxides and \\nhydroxides. They also form hydrides \\nand halides with hydrogen and halogens \\nrespectively. Industrially important \\ncompounds of calcium include calcium \\noxide (lime), calcium hydroxide (slaked \\nlime), calcium sulphate hemihydrate  \\n(Plaster of Paris), calcium carbonate \\n(limestone) and cement. Portland cement \\nis an important constructional material. It \\nis manufactured by heating a pulverised \\nmixture of limestone and clay in a rotary \\nkiln. The clinker thus obtained is mixed \\nwith some gypsum (2-3%) to give a fine \\npowder of cement. All these substances \\nfind variety of uses in different areas.\\n Monovalent sodium and potassium \\nions and divalent magnesium and calcium \\nions are found in large proportions in \\nbiological fluids. These ions perform \\nimportant biological functions such as \\nmaintenance of ion balance and nerve \\nimpulse conduction. \\n11th Chemistry Chapter-5 Vol-1 EM.indd   14911th Chemistry Chapter-5 Vol-1 EM.indd   149 09-01-2023   10:54:4109-01-2023   10:54:41'),\n",

Introduction\\n We can survive for weeks without \\nfood, days without water, but only minutes \\nwithout air. Thus, we inhale a lungful of \\nair every few seconds, keep some of the \\nmolecules for our own end, and some of \\nthe molecules that our body no longer \\nneeds, and exhale the mixture back into \\nthe surrounding air. The air around \\nus is in the gaseous state, which is the \\nsimplest of the states of matter. Although \\nthe chemical behaviour of gases depends \\non their composition, all the gases have \\nremarkably similar physical behaviour.\\nDo you know the difference  \\nbetween gas and vapour?  \\nGas is a substance that is normally \\nin a gaseous state at room temperature \\nand 1 atm pressure, while vapour is the \\ngaseous form of any substance that is a \\nliquid or solid at room temperature and \\n1 atm pressure.\\n Earth is surrounded by an \\natmosphere of air whose composition \\nin volume percentage is roughly 78 % \\nnitrogen, 21 % oxygen and 1 % other \\ngases. Of the known  elements, only eleven \\nare gases under normal atmospheric \\nconditions. The elements hydrogen (H 2), \\nnitrogen (N 2), oxygen (O 2), fluorine \\n(F2) and chlorine (Cl 2) exist as gaseous \\ndiatomic molecules. Another form of \\noxygen, namely, ozone (O 3) is also a gas \\nat room temperature. The noble gases, \\nnamely, helium (He), neon (Ne), argon \\n(Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe) and radon \\n(Rn) of 18 th group  are monatomic gases. \\nCompounds such as carbon monoxide \\n(CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitrogen \\ndioxide (NO 2) and nitric oxide (NO) \\nalso exist in gaseous state under normal \\natmospheric conditions. In this unit you \\nwill learn the properties of gases and other \\nrelated phenomena. \\n6.2. The Gas Laws\\n The gas laws have played a major \\nrole in the development of chemistry. \\nThe physical properties of all gases \\nare governed by the gas laws that were \\nformulated based on the studies of the \\nproperties like pressure, volume, etc., as a \\nfunction of temperature. Before studying \\nthe gas laws in detail, let us understand \\nan important parameter, namely, the  \\npressure. \\n Pressure is defined as force divided \\nby the area to which the force is applied. \\nThe SI unit of pressure is pascal which \\nis defined as 1 Newton per square meter \\n(Nm-2).

The \\nschematic of the apparatus used by him is \\nshown in figure 6.1. \\nFigure. 6.1 Boyle’s law experiment\\n Mercury was added through the \\nopen end of the apparatus such that the \\nmercury level on both ends are equal as \\nshown in the figure 6.1(a). Add more \\namount of mercury until the volume of \\nthe trapped air is reduced to half of its \\noriginal volume as shown in figure 6.1(b). \\nThe pressure exerted on the gas by the \\naddition of excess mercury is given by the \\ndifference in mercury levels of the tube. \\nInitially the pressure exerted by the gas is \\nequal to 1 atm as the difference in height \\nof the mercury levels is zero. When the \\nvolume is reduced to half, the difference in \\nmercury levels increases to 760 mm. Now \\nthe pressure exerted by the gas is equal \\nto 2 atm. It led him to conclude that at a \\ngiven temperature the volume occupied \\nby a fixed mass of a gas is inversely \\nproportional to i ts pressure. \\n Mathematically, the Boyle’s law can \\nbe written as \\n  \\nV Pα 1 ------- (6.1)\\n(T and n are fixed, T-temperature,                            \\nn- number of moles)\\nVk P=× 1\\n ------- (6.2)\\nk – proportionality constant \\nWhen we rearrange equation 6.2. \\nPV = k ------  (6.2a)(at constant \\ntemperature and mass)\\n Boyle’s law is applicable to all \\ngases regardless of their chemical identity \\n(provided the pressure is low).

The pressure is \\ndue to the force of the gas particles on the \\nwalls of the container. If a given amount \\nof gas is compressed to half of its volume, \\nthe density is doubled and the number \\nof particles hitting the unit area of the \\ncontainer will be doubled. Hence, the \\npressure would increase twofold.\\nConsequence of Boyle’s law  \\n The pressure-density relationship \\ncan be derived from the Boyle’s law as \\nshown below. \\n P 1V1 = P2V2  (Boyle’s law)\\n \\nP m\\nd P m\\nd\\n1\\n1\\n2\\n2\\n=\\n \\n where “m” is the mass, d 1 and d2 are \\nthe densities of gases at pressure P 1 and P2.\\n P\\nd\\nP\\nd\\n1\\n1\\n2\\n2\\n=  ------ (6.4)\\n In other words, the density of a gas \\nis directly proportional to pressure.\\nAll the passenger \\naeroplane cabins have to \\nbe artificially pressurised. \\ndo you know why?\\n Most commercial aeroplanes fly at \\nabout 30,000 feet altitude. The pressure \\ndecreases with the increase in altitude \\nas there are fewer molecules per unit \\nvolume of air. Hence, while at air,  the \\npressure around the aeroplane will be \\nso low that one could pass out for lack \\nof oxygen. For this reason aeroplanes \\ncabins are artificially pressurized.\\n  Similarly, the effect of drop in \\npressure is felt as a little pain in the \\nears by a person while ascending a \\nmountain in a plain.  Though the \\nexternal pressure drops, the internal \\npressure within the ear cavities remains \\nthe same. This creates an imbalance. \\nThe greater internal pressure forces \\nthe eardrum to bulge outward causing \\npain. The excess air within the ear \\ncavities escapes after some time and \\nwith the help of yawning and thereby \\nequalizing the internal and external \\npressure to relieve the pain. \\nUnderwater divers are advised not to \\nhold the breath unnecessarily while \\ndiving.

Gases whose behaviour is \\nconsistent with these assumptions under \\nall conditions are called ideal gases. But \\nin practice both these assumptions are not \\nvalid under all conditions. For example, \\nthe fact that gases can be liquefied shows \\nthat the attractive force exists among \\nmolecules. Hence, there is no gas which \\nbehaves ideally under all conditions. \\nThe non-ideal gases are called real gases. \\nThe real gases tend to approach the ideal \\nbehaviour under certain conditions. \\n6.5.1 Compressibility factor Z\\n The deviation of real gases from \\nideal behaviour is measured in terms of \\na ratio of PV to nRT. This is termed as \\ncompressibility factor. Mathematically, \\nZ PV\\nnRT=\\n For ideal gases PV = nRT, hence \\nthe  compressibility factor, Z = 1 at all \\ntemperatures and pressures. For these \\ngases the plot of Z vs P should be a \\nstraight line parallel to the pressure axis. \\nWhen a gas deviates from ideal behaviour, \\nits Z value deviates from unity. For all \\ngases, at very low pressures and very high \\ntemperature the compressibility factor \\napproaches unity and they tend to behave \\nideally.

The speed of a molecule \\nmoving towards the wall of the container is \\nreduced by the attractive forces exerted by \\nits neighbours.

Thermodynamics, the study of \\nthe transformation of energy, explains all \\nsuch processes quantitatively and allows \\nus to make useful predictions.  \\n In the 19 th century, scientists tried \\nto  understand the underlying principles \\nof steam engine which were  already \\nin operation, in order to improve their \\nefficiency. The basic problem of the \\ninvestigation was the transformation of \\nheat into mechanical work. However, \\nover time, the laws of thermodynamics  \\nwere developed and helped to understand \\nthe process of steam engine. These laws \\nhave been used to deduce powerful \\nmathematical relationships applicable to a \\nbroad range of processes.\\n Thermodynamics evaluates the \\nmacroscopic properties (heat, work) and \\ntheir inter relationships. It deals with \\nproperties of systems in equilibrium \\nand is independent of any theories or \\nproperties of the individual molecules \\nwhich constitute the system.\\n The principles of  thermodynamics \\nare based on  three laws of thermodynamics. \\nThe first two laws (First and second law) \\nsummarise the actual experience of inter \\nconversion of different forms of energy. \\nThe third law deals with the calculation \\nof entropy and the unattainability of \\nabsolute  zero Kelvin. Thermodynamics \\ncarries high practical values but bears \\ncertain limitations. It is independent \\nof atomic and molecular structure and \\nreaction mechanism. The laws can be \\nused to predict whether a particular \\nreaction is feasible or not under a given \\nset of conditions, but they cannot give the \\nrate at which the reaction takes place. In \\nother words, thermodynamics deals with \\nequilibrium conditions quantitatively, \\nbut does not take into account the kinetic \\napproach to the equilibrium state.\\n7.2 System and Surrounding\\n Before studying the laws of \\nthermodynamics and their applications, \\nit is important to understand the meaning \\nof a few terms used frequently in \\nthermodynamics.\\nSystem:\\n The universe is divided into two \\nparts, the system and its surroundings.  \\nThe system is the part of universe which \\nis under thermodynamic consideration.

For example, the allotropes of \\ncarbon, namely, graphite (C graphite ) and \\ndiamond (Cdiamond ), differ from each other \\nbecause they possess different internal \\nenergies and have different structures.\\nCharacteristics of internal energy (U):  \\n• The internal energy of a system is an \\nextensive property. It depends on the \\namount of the substances present in \\nthe system. If the amount is doubled, \\nthe internal energy is also doubled. \\n• The internal energy of a system is a \\nstate function. It depends only upon \\nthe state variables (T, P , V , n) of the \\nsystem. The change in internal energy \\ndoes not depend on the path by which \\nthe final state is reached. \\n• The change in internal energy of a \\nsystem is expressed as ΔU= Uf – Ui \\n• In a cyclic process, there is no internal \\nenergy change. ΔU(cyclic)  = 0\\n• If the internal energy of the system \\nin the final state ( Uf) is less than the \\ninternal energy of the system in its \\ninitial state (U i), then ΔU would be \\nnegative. \\nΔU=Uf − Ui = −ve   (U f < Ui)\\n• If the internal energy of the system \\nin the final state (U f) is greater than \\nthe internal energy of the system in \\nits initial state(U i), then ΔU would be \\npositive. \\nΔU=Uf − Ui = +ve    (U f > Ui)\\n11th Std Chemistry 186-228.indd   19111th Std Chemistry 186-228.indd   191 23-12-2021   15:33:4523-12-2021   15:33:45'),\n",

There are two kinds \\nof thermodynamic properties called (1) \\nintensive - independent of the quantity \\nof material and (2) extensive - directly \\nproportional to the quantity of material. \\nThere are five basic thermodynamic \\nproperties. (U,H,S and G)\\nThermodynamic Processes: \\n Adiabatic process in which no heat \\ntransfer takes place (q = 0)\\n Isothermal process in which \\ntemperature remains constant (dT =0).\\n Isobaric process in which pressure \\nremains constant(dP =0).\\n Isochoric process in which volume \\nremains constant(dV =0).\\n Cyclic process in which the system \\nreturns to its original state after completing \\na series of changes. \\n Internal energy (U):  Internal \\nenergy of a system is equal to the energy \\npossessed by all its constituents namely \\natoms, ions and molecules. The energy of \\na system of molecules is equal to the sum \\nof its translational energy, vibrational \\nenergy, rotational energy, bond energy, \\nelectronic energy and energy due to \\nmolecular interactions.\\nHeat: Heat is regarded as the energy in \\ntransit across the boundary separating \\na system from its surrounding. Heat is a \\npath function. The SI unit of heat is joule \\n(J)\\nWork :  Work is defined as the force (F) \\nmultiplied by the displacement -w=F .x, \\nwork is measured in Joules, i.e the SI \\nunit of work is Joule.
